# Lotto (du≈ºy lotek)
Programm created for multiple reasons
1. To show my wife how many attempts (& how much money must be spent) to make some hits in Lotto
2. To try myself in basic Python syntax (variables, loops, functions)

### First update
1. Created this repository & pushed
2. Tried some branching stuff & made translation to english

The lmlp branch will be used to make this program Look More Like Python ;)
